# Eventuali Dashboard Workflow - FIXED ✅

## Overview

The git submodule integration issue has been resolved! The UI can now be developed and published seamlessly.

## How it Works

- **`.apps/ui/`**: Git submodule (unchanged) - your primary development location
- **`eventuali-dashboard`**: Symlink pointing to `.apps/ui/` - used for NPM package building
- **One codebase, multiple uses**: Same code serves both development and NPM publication

## Your Development Workflow (Unchanged!)

### 1. Make UI Changes
```bash
cd .apps/ui/
# Make your changes here as usual
# This is still your git submodule - all git operations work normally
```

### 2. Pull Updates from UI Repository
```bash
git submodule update --remote .apps/ui/
# Your changes automatically appear in eventuali-dashboard/ too (via symlink)
```

### 3. Publish to NPM (When Ready)
```bash
cd eventuali-dashboard/  # This is now a symlink to .apps/ui/
npm run build:lib
npm publish  # Will publish @eventuali/dashboard
```

## What Changed

### Before (Broken)
- `.apps/ui/` - git submodule ✅
- `eventuali-dashboard/` - separate copy ❌ (broke workflow)

### After (Fixed)  
- `.apps/ui/` - git submodule ✅
- `eventuali-dashboard/` - symlink to `.apps/ui/` ✅
- Updates in `.apps/ui/` automatically appear in `eventuali-dashboard/` ✅

## NPM Package Configuration

The UI submodule now includes:
- ✅ NPM package metadata (`@eventuali/dashboard`)
- ✅ Library build configuration (`npm run build:lib`)
- ✅ TypeScript definitions generation
- ✅ Professional README and LICENSE

## Benefits

1. **No Workflow Changes**: Your existing UI development process is unchanged
2. **Automatic Sync**: Updates propagate immediately via symlink
3. **Single Source of Truth**: No code duplication
4. **NPM Ready**: Professional package configuration included
5. **Version Control**: All changes tracked in the UI submodule's git history

## Commands Summary

```bash
# Development (same as before)
cd .apps/ui/
npm run dev

# Publishing (new)
cd eventuali-dashboard/
npm run build:lib
npm publish
```

## Verification

The fix has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Symlink created correctly
- ✅ Library build works (`npm run build:lib`)  
- ✅ Development build works (`npm run build`)
- ✅ TypeScript definitions generated
- ✅ All package metadata configured correctly

Your workflow is now fully restored! 🎉
