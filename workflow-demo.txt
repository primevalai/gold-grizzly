# Agentic Coordination Examples

## Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns

### 1. Sequential Agent Chain
```
orchestrator -> data-fetcher -> analyzer -> reporter -> archiver
```
Example: Fetch API data, analyze trends, generate report, store results

### 2. Parallel Agent Execution  
```
orchestrator -> [agent-a, agent-b, agent-c] -> consolidator
```
Example: Process multiple data sources simultaneously, then merge results

### 3. Conditional Agent Routing
```
orchestrator -> validator -> [success-path | error-path] -> finalizer
```
Example: Validate input, route to different processors based on validation result

### 4. Event-Driven Agent Coordination
```
trigger-event -> listener-agent -> publisher-agent -> [subscriber-agents]
```
Example: File upload triggers processing agents that emit completion events

### 5. Hierarchical Agent Delegation
```
parent-agent -> [child-agent-1 -> grandchild-agents] -> parent-agent
```
Example: Project manager delegates to team leads who delegate to specialists

## Real-World Scenarios

### E-commerce Order Processing
1. **Order Validator** - Validates customer and inventory
2. **Payment Processor** - Handles payment transactions  
3. **Inventory Manager** - Updates stock levels
4. **Fulfillment Agent** - Coordinates shipping
5. **Notification Agent** - Sends customer updates

### Content Publishing Pipeline
1. **Content Ingester** - Receives raw content
2. **Editor Agent** - Reviews and edits content
3. **SEO Optimizer** - Optimizes for search engines
4. **Publisher Agent** - Publishes to platforms
5. **Analytics Tracker** - Monitors performance

### Data Science Workflow
1. **Data Collector** - Gathers data from sources
2. **Data Cleaner** - Preprocesses and validates data
3. **Feature Engineer** - Creates model features
4. **Model Trainer** - Trains ML models
5. **Model Evaluator** - Tests model performance
6. **Deployment Agent** - Deploys model to production

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Event-Based Communication
- Agents emit events to signal completion
- Other agents subscribe to relevant events
- Enables loose coupling and scalability

### Shared State Management
- Agents read/write to shared data stores
- Coordination through state synchronization
- Requires careful concurrency handling

### Message Passing
- Direct agent-to-agent communication
- Queue-based message delivery
- Enables complex conversation patterns

### Workflow Orchestration
- Central orchestrator manages agent execution
- Defines workflow logic and dependencies  
- Provides monitoring and error handling

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each agent has one clear purpose
2. **Loose Coupling** - Agents communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. **Error Resilience** - Handle failures gracefully with retries/fallbacks
4. **Monitoring** - Track agent performance and workflow health
5. **Scalability** - Design for horizontal scaling of agent instances
6. **Versioning** - Manage agent interface changes carefully

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Tight Coupling** - Agents directly dependent on internal details
- **Circular Dependencies** - Agents creating deadlock conditions
- **Shared Mutable State** - Race conditions and inconsistent data
- **Monolithic Agents** - Single agent doing too many things
- **Synchronous Blocking** - Agents waiting unnecessarily for responses

## Event System Integration

This workflow-demo.txt was created by the Simon Says agent as part of the Gold Grizzly event telemetry system, demonstrating:
- Agent lifecycle tracking through events
- Workflow correlation via correlation IDs
- Parent-child agent relationships
- Command execution simulation
