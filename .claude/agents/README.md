## Usage Notes

- All agents follow the Gold Grizzly evented format with MCP event tools integration
- Each agent includes comprehensive documentation and usage instructions
- Agents can be invoked individually or through orchestrator agents
- The folder structure supports easy discovery and logical grouping of related functionality

## Event System Integration

All agents in this directory are integrated with the Gold Grizzly Event System and emit events following the pattern:
```
agent.<agentName>.<eventName>
```

This enables comprehensive tracking, monitoring, and coordination across the entire agent ecosystem.
