  "situation_description": "User expressing amusement at the meta-irony of having to write extremely detailed, step-by-step instructions to prevent an AI from batching events at the end instead of outputting them in real-time. The humor lies in the recursive nature of having to be incredibly explicit about timing and sequencing in instructions designed to capture spontaneous moments.",
