  "trigger_phrase": "This is absolutely wild - Simon Says is now a formal workflow orchestration pattern in enterprise software development!",
  "situation_description": "A moment of pure ironic realization when the user discovered that the childhood game 'Simon Says' has evolved into a legitimate enterprise software development pattern. The Gold Grizzly project contains a sophisticated workflow orchestration system with agent-based task execution, where 'Simon Says' commands are now formal directives in a distributed event-driven architecture.",
  "user_reaction": "Complete bewilderment and amusement at the absurd evolution from playground game to enterprise software pattern. The exclamation captures that perfect developer moment when you realize something ridiculous has become completely serious and mission-critical.",
