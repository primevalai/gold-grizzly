# Orchestration Agent Merge Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the unified orchestration system that merged two previous agents (`orchestrator.md` and `system-orchestrator.md`) into a single, more powerful `workflow-orchestrator.md` agent for optimal efficacy.

## Merge Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Merged Agents**: `orchestrator.md` + `system-orchestrator.md` → `workflow-orchestrator.md`  
**Status**: Active  

### Original Agents (Archived)

#### orchestrator.md (Archived)
- **Model**: Sonnet
- **Color**: Purple
- **Strengths**: 
  - Strong parallel execution bias with detailed parallelization analysis
  - Dynamic agent discovery at runtime
  - Sophisticated execution handoff to Claude Code
  - Detailed context generation for agent invocations
  - Emphasis on avoiding nested agents (memory overflow prevention)

#### system-orchestrator.md (Archived)
- **Model**: Opus 
- **Color**: Gold
- **Strengths**:
  - Strict workflow sequencing (Architecture → Planning → Implementation)
  - Comprehensive TodoWrite tracking throughout workflow
  - Strong enforcement of architectural foundation requirement
  - Integration with shared workflow principles
  - More structured phase validation and quality gates

### Unified Agent: workflow-orchestrator.md

#### Configuration
- **Model**: Opus (for complex orchestration capacity)
- **Color**: Gold (indicating primary orchestration role)
- **Tools**: Task, Read, Write, Bash, TodoWrite, Glob, Grep, MultiEdit, MCP event tools

#### Key Features

**Proactive Invocation (NEW)**:
- **Explicit Keywords**: "orchestrate", "coordinate", "plan", "design", "architect", "build system", "implement feature"
- **Complexity Indicators**: Multiple components, cross-cutting concerns, system-level changes, tasks > 30 minutes
- **Auto-Invocation**: Automatically engages for complex requests without explicit mention

**Merged Capabilities**:
- **Architectural Foundation**: Strict Architecture → Planning → Implementation sequence (from system-orchestrator)
- **Parallel Optimization**: Dynamic parallelization analysis with git worktree support (from orchestrator)
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: TodoWrite integration with event telemetry throughout workflow
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Runtime agent discovery with capability analysis
- **Execution Handoff**: Structured handoff to Claude Code for parallel execution batches

**Enhanced Workflow**:
1. **Initialization**: Workflow context + TodoWrite + dynamic agent discovery
2. **Architecture Phase**: Architect-orchestrator with parallel opportunity analysis
3. **Planning Phase**: Planning-orchestrator with parallel optimization
4. **Implementation Phase**: Coordinated specialized agents with parallel batching
5. **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive validation with parallel execution monitoring
6. **Completion**: Full deliverables with efficiency metrics

## Usage Guidelines

### When workflow-orchestrator is Invoked

**Automatically Triggered By**:
- Complex feature development ("Add user authentication")
- System design requests ("Create a notification system")  
- Multi-component refactoring ("Modernize payment processing")
- Integration tasks ("Connect to Stripe and SendGrid")
- Architecture decisions needed
- Multiple agent coordination required

**Explicit Invocation Keywords**:
- "orchestrate", "coordinate", "plan", "design system"
- "build application", "implement feature", "workflow"
- "multi-agent", "complex task", "refactor", "modernize"

### Agent Responsibilities

**Workflow Management**:
- Create unique workflow IDs for tracking
- Initialize TodoWrite and event systems
- Manage workflow lifecycle from creation to completion
- Ensure proper sequencing of agent invocations

**Parallel Execution Optimization**:
- Analyze agent parallelization opportunities at each phase
- Organize independent agents into parallel batches
- Resolve resource conflicts through isolation strategies
- Optimize execution efficiency while maintaining quality

**Agent Orchestration**:
- Invoke agents using Task tool with appropriate contexts
- Pass workflow context between agents with unique IDs
- Monitor agent execution status with event telemetry
- Handle failures and coordinate recoveries

**Context Propagation**:
- Maintain consistent workflow context across all agents
- Generate unique agent IDs for proper causation tracking
- Track dependencies between agent outputs
- Enable complete workflow traceability

### Quality Assurance

**Mandatory Validations**:
- ✓ Architecture completed before planning
- ✓ Planning grounded in architectural decisions
- ✓ Implementation respects both architecture and planning
- ✓ Parallel execution conflicts identified and resolved
- ✓ Quality gates passed at each phase
- ✓ Event telemetry properly tracked

**Error Prevention**:
- **Never** skip architectural foundation
- **Never** create nested agents (causes memory overflow)
- **Always** use Task tool for agent delegation
- **Always** generate unique context IDs
- **Always** update TodoWrite status after completions

## Migration Notes

### For Agent Authors
- Update references to `orchestrator` or `system-orchestrator` → `workflow-orchestrator`
- New agent follows same context propagation patterns
- Event names now use `agent.workflowOrchestrator.*` format
- All MCP event tool integrations remain compatible

### For Users
- No change in usage - proactive invocation means the agent engages automatically for complex tasks
- More efficient execution through parallel optimization
- Better tracking through comprehensive TodoWrite integration
- Stricter quality gates ensure higher deliverable quality

## Performance Benefits

**Parallel Execution Optimizations**:
- Independent agents execute simultaneously (estimated 60% time reduction)
- Git worktree isolation enables filesystem conflict resolution
- Network operations parallelized unless rate limits detected
- Same-agent-type instances run in parallel unless resource conflicts

**Quality Improvements**:
- Architectural foundation prevents planning without technical context
- Comprehensive validation at each workflow phase
- Event telemetry enables complete workflow observability
- TodoWrite integration provides user visibility throughout process

**Resource Efficiency**:
- Dynamic agent discovery prevents hardcoded assumptions
- Intelligent batch organization optimizes Claude Code execution
- Context propagation enables proper causation tracking
- Execution handoff prevents memory overflow from nested agents

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If issues arise with the unified agent:

1. **Restore original agents**:
   ```bash
   mv archive/orchestrator.md ./
   mv archive/system-orchestrator.md ./
   ```

2. **Remove unified agent**:
   ```bash
   rm workflow-orchestrator.md
   ```

3. **Update any agent references** back to original names

4. **Report issues** for analysis and future merge improvements
