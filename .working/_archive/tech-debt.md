# Technical Debt Tracking

This file tracks technical debt, temporary implementations, and future improvements needed across the project.

## Guidelines

- **NO PLACEHOLDERS**: All code must be fully implemented when written
- **NO "TODO LATER"**: Technical debt must be tracked here and addressed promptly  
- **IMMEDIATE TRACKING**: Any temporary solution must be documented here immediately
- **PRIORITY LEVELS**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **OWNERSHIP**: Each item must have a clear owner/responsible party
