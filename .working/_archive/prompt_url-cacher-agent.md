Call this the url-cacher. This agent will download the content of a given URL by using the Playwright MCP server with a  headless browser. This will be used as reference information for work that other agents will perfom, this is not the core functionality of the system so is really considered metadata. The content will get stored in the .metadata/cache/<slug of the URL TLD> folder. Inside that folder the content will be stored based on the path of the URL. All url segments will be converted to slug-based kebab-cased naming and a directory structure built that follows a "subdirectory-per-segment" pattern. The content that is downloaded needs to be usable by an LLM which structured HTML should be, so no conversion should be necessary at this time. I want to be able to invoke this agent as a custom slash-command as well so that it will run as an isolated Task. It should be used proactively whenever I say something like "cache the <URL> ...". When the URL is pulled a file at the lowest segment-folder will get created, named `.last-updated-<slug-formatted ISO 8601 with UTC TZ timestamp>` with the current time. If the agent is asked to retrieve a URL and the last-updated timestamp of the file is less than a day, it will not get retreived. If it is older than a day, the last-updated file will get renamed with the current time and the content will get refreshed following a purge-and-reload pattern. If the URL cannot be retrieved the current content should not get purged and the last-updated file should not be renamed. There are three posssible results: url-cached, url-already-cached, or url-cache-failed. If the result is url-cached, a JSON object with relevant data about the content should be returned. If the result is url-cache-failed, a JSON object with relevant data about the failure should be returned. If the result is url-already-cached, a JSON object with relevant data about the current state of the cache should be returned. 

Examples: 
- The URL https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide would get stored in the following folder: .metadata/cache/docs-anthropic-com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide
