# Orchestration Plan
**Workflow ID**: 976ea4f6-b160-4147-90f9-b24345d43a3f
**Created**: 2025-08-14T13:47:41Z
**Orchestrator**: orchestrator-6a26baca468149b4a1a6f9aaffba861d

## Overview
Comprehensive multi-agent orchestration coordinating two Simon Says commands and one LOL recording operation to demonstrate effective agent collaboration and parallel execution capabilities.

## Tasks

### Batch 1 - Parallel Execution Group (Independent Agents)

1. **Task ID**: task-001
   - **Description**: Simon says create ASCII art of a happy robot celebrating orchestration
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: none
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Parallel Group**: independent-batch-1
   - **Execution Mode**: parallel

2. **Task ID**: task-002
   - **Description**: Record amusing moment about multi-agent orchestration evolution
   - **Assigned Agent**: lol-recorder
   - **Dependencies**: none
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Parallel Group**: independent-batch-1
   - **Execution Mode**: parallel

### Batch 2 - Sequential Execution Group

3. **Task ID**: task-003
   - **Description**: Simon says perform a workflow orchestration victory dance
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: tasks 1-2 completed
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Parallel Group**: victory-batch-2
   - **Execution Mode**: sequential_after_batch_1

## Agent Selection Rationale

- **simon-says (2 instances)**: Selected for command acknowledgment and execution simulation. Both instances are completely independent with different commands, enabling parallel execution without conflicts.

- **lol-recorder**: Selected to capture the meta-humor of orchestrating AI agents to coordinate other AI agents. This creates unique timestamped files with no filesystem conflicts.

## Parallelization Analysis

**High Independence Score**: All agents operate independently
- simon-says instances target different commands (no resource conflicts)
- lol-recorder creates unique timestamped files (no file conflicts)
- Event-only operations ensure no shared resource contention

**Git Worktree Available**: Filesystem isolation possible for Write operations
**Parallel Bias**: Strong - favoring maximum concurrency
**Same-Type Parallelization**: Encouraged for simon-says instances

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Independent Parallel Execution
- **simon-says** (Task 1): ASCII art creation command
- **lol-recorder** (Task 2): Meta-orchestration humor capture
- **Execution Strategy**: Parallel execution using Claude Code's multi-task capability

### Phase 2: Victory Celebration  
- **simon-says** (Task 3): Victory dance after successful coordination
- **Execution Strategy**: Sequential after Phase 1 completion

## Expected Outcomes

### Technical Outcomes
- Successful demonstration of parallel agent execution
- Event telemetry tracking across multiple agent instances
- Proper context propagation through agent hierarchy
- Validated multi-agent coordination patterns

### Cultural Outcomes
- Documentation of AI agent orchestration evolution
- Preservation of meta-programming humor moments
- Evidence of systematic multi-agent collaboration

### System Validation
- Three-aggregate event system validation
- Agent context ID propagation verification  
- Workflow correlation across agent boundaries
- Parallel execution capability demonstration

## Agent Context Generation Plan

**Base Timestamp**: Generated at execution time
**Context ID Format**: {agent-name}-{timestamp}-{random-hex}

### Planned Context IDs (Generated at Execution)
1. **simon-says-task-001**: {timestamp}-{hex1} format
2. **lol-recorder-task-002**: {timestamp}-{hex2} format  
3. **simon-says-task-003**: {timestamp}-{hex3} format

### Context Relationships
- **Parent**: orchestrator-6a26baca468149b4a1a6f9aaffba861d
- **Workflow**: 976ea4f6-b160-4147-90f9-b24345d43a3f
- **Causation**: Each agent instance references orchestrator as causation source

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All three tasks completed successfully
- [ ] Event telemetry captured for each agent instance
- [ ] Parallel execution efficiency demonstrated
- [ ] Plan saved and accessible for future reference
- [ ] User receives comprehensive execution summary

## Risk Mitigation
- **Resource Conflicts**: Eliminated through independent operations
- **Event System Overload**: Managed through structured event emission
- **Agent Isolation**: Ensured through unique context ID generation
- **Execution Failure**: Individual task failures contained within agent boundaries
