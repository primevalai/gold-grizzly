# Orchestration Plan: Simon Says Multi-Agent Coordination
**Workflow ID**: e55f6d96-dc46-4c14-963f-8ca8b283896b
**Created**: 2025-08-14T13:59:05Z
**Orchestrator**: orchestrator-7201ebceb3ab491aabd087f87d894f1d

## Overview
Coordinate multiple simon-says agents to execute three specific commands while simultaneously capturing the humorous nature of this coordination through a lol-recorder agent. This demonstrates parallel agent execution with proper event telemetry and context propagation.

## Tasks

### Batch 1: Parallel Simon Says Commands (3 agents)
1. **Task ID**: simon-task-001
   - **Description**: Simon says create a test file called hello.txt
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Context ID**: simon-says-1755179981-e3634c8c
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Execution Mode**: Parallel with Batch 1

2. **Task ID**: simon-task-002
   - **Description**: Simon says list the current directory contents
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Context ID**: simon-says-1755179982-3ea64a79
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Execution Mode**: Parallel with Batch 1

3. **Task ID**: simon-task-003
   - **Description**: Simon says check the git status
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Context ID**: simon-says-1755179983-330fb466
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Execution Mode**: Parallel with Batch 1

### Batch 2: Humor Documentation (1 agent)
4. **Task ID**: lol-task-001
   - **Description**: Document the ridiculous coordination of Simon Says commands to multiple agents simultaneously
   - **Assigned Agent**: lol-recorder
   - **Context ID**: lol-recorder-1755179984-3fe30ab8
   - **Dependencies**: Can run parallel with Batch 1 (no conflicts)
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Execution Mode**: Parallel with Batch 1

## Agent Selection Rationale
- **simon-says**: Selected for three instances because each command starts with "Simon says" and requires proper acknowledgment and event tracking. Each instance operates independently with unique context IDs.
- **lol-recorder**: Selected because the user described this situation as "ridiculous" and "hilarious", triggering the humor documentation agent to preserve this development moment.

## Parallelization Strategy
- **High Independence**: All agents (simon-says and lol-recorder) are highly parallel-safe:
  - simon-says agents only emit events, no file system conflicts
  - lol-recorder writes unique timestamped files in .lol-agent directory
- **Git Worktree Available**: Additional filesystem isolation available if needed
- **Execution Pattern**: All 4 agents can execute in parallel as Batch 1

## Execution Order
**BATCH 1 - All Parallel Execution:**
1. simon-says (hello.txt command)
2. simon-says (directory listing command) 
3. simon-says (git status command)
4. lol-recorder (humor documentation)

## Expected Outcomes
- Three Simon Says commands acknowledged and "executed" with proper event telemetry
- Comprehensive humor documentation capturing the meta-nature of coordinating Simon Says commands
- Full event correlation across all agent instances using workflow ID: e55f6d96-dc46-4c14-963f-8ca8b283896b
- Demonstration of parallel agent orchestration capabilities

## Event Telemetry Chain
- All agents inherit correlation ID: e55f6d96-dc46-4c14-963f-8ca8b283896b
- Parent agent: orchestrator-7201ebceb3ab491aabd087f87d894f1d
- Event aggregate pattern: Each agent maintains separate aggregate with unique ID
- Full traceability from orchestration through execution completion

## Context Templates
Each agent will receive standardized context blocks with their unique IDs, workflow correlation, and parent references for complete event system integration.
