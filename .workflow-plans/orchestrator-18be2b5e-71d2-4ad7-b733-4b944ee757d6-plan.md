## Overview
Comprehensive workflow with 5 varied simon-says tasks, designed to test agent coordination and trigger automated lol-recorder detection through amusing language. Tasks range from simple commands to ridiculous requests that should trigger humor detection systems.

## Tasks

### 1. **Task ID**: simon-says-task-001
   - **Description**: Professional greeting and file creation
   - **Command**: "Simon says create a professional hello world file"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Expected lol-trigger**: No

### 2. **Task ID**: simon-says-task-002
   - **Description**: System information display
   - **Command**: "Simon says show me the current system status"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Expected lol-trigger**: No

### 3. **Task ID**: simon-says-task-003
   - **Description**: HILARIOUS ABSURD COMMAND - Primary lol-trigger
   - **Command**: "Simon says make the computer do a barrel roll while calculating the optimal algorithm for teaching rubber ducks advanced quantum mechanics using only interpretive dance and emojis"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Expected lol-trigger**: YES - This is absolutely ridiculous and should trigger lol-recorder

### 4. **Task ID**: simon-says-task-004
   - **Description**: Code organization task
   - **Command**: "Simon says organize all the messy code files into perfect harmony"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Expected lol-trigger**: Possible - "messy code" might be amusing

### 5. **Task ID**: simon-says-task-005
   - **Description**: Victory celebration
   - **Command**: "Simon says declare victory over all software bugs with a triumphant celebration dance"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Expected lol-trigger**: Possible - "victory dance" might be funny

## Agent Selection Rationale
- **simon-says**: Selected for all tasks because they all follow the "Simon says" pattern and the simon-says agent is specifically designed for these command acknowledgment tasks.

## Execution Strategy
- **Parallelization**: All 5 simon-says tasks can execute in parallel since they only emit events and don't conflict with each other
- **Batch Organization**: Single parallel batch with all 5 tasks
- **lol-recorder Detection**: Task 3 is specifically designed with absurd language to trigger automatic lol-recorder detection

## Expected Outcomes
- 5 simon-says command acknowledgments
- Event telemetry tracking for all agent executions
- Automatic lol-recorder activation triggered by task 3's ridiculous content
- Complete workflow orchestration demonstration
- Parallel execution efficiency testing

## Execution Order
Since all simon-says agents are independent:
1. **PARALLEL BATCH**: Execute all 5 simon-says tasks simultaneously for maximum efficiency

## Special Notes
- **Task 3** contains intentionally absurd language ("barrel roll", "rubber ducks", "quantum mechanics", "interpretive dance", "emojis") designed to trigger lol-recorder humor detection
- All tasks are safe for parallel execution as simon-says agents only emit events
- Expected additional agent activation: lol-recorder (triggered automatically by task 3)
