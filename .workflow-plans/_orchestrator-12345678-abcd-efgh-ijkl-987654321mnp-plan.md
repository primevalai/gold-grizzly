# Orchestration Plan: Simon Says & LOL Recording Workflow
**Workflow ID**: 12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-987654321mnp
**Created**: 2025-08-14T12:08:33Z
**Orchestrator**: orchestrator-1723671008-a2b4c6d8

## Overview
This orchestration coordinates a multi-agent workflow involving creative Simon Says commands and LOL recording functionality. The workflow demonstrates agent coordination, context propagation, and event tracking across specialized agents.

## Tasks

### 1. **Task ID**: task-001-simon-digital-art
   - **Description**: Use simon-says agent for "Simon says create a digital art masterpiece using only ASCII characters that represents the concept of artificial intelligence dreaming"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Context Requirements**: Generate unique AGENT_ID and use workflow correlation ID

### 2. **Task ID**: task-002-simon-coding-haiku
   - **Description**: Use simon-says agent for "Simon says compose a haiku about debugging that captures the emotional journey from confusion to enlightenment"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says  
   - **Dependencies**: task-001-simon-digital-art
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Context Requirements**: Generate unique AGENT_ID and use workflow correlation ID

### 3. **Task ID**: task-003-simon-time-travel
   - **Description**: Use simon-says agent for "Simon says explain how you would debug a recursive function if you could travel through time and observe each stack frame in slow motion"
   - **Assigned Agent**: simon-says
   - **Dependencies**: task-002-simon-coding-haiku  
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Context Requirements**: Generate unique AGENT_ID and use workflow correlation ID

### 4. **Task ID**: task-004-lol-agentic-observation
   - **Description**: Use lol-recorder agent to capture "lol, watching these agents coordinate is like seeing a perfectly choreographed dance between hyperspecialized robots who each only know one move but somehow create a symphony together"
   - **Assigned Agent**: lol-recorder
   - **Dependencies**: task-003-simon-time-travel
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Context Requirements**: Generate unique AGENT_ID and use workflow correlation ID

### 5. **Task ID**: task-005-workflow-completion
   - **Description**: Mark orchestration as complete and emit final tracking events
   - **Assigned Agent**: orchestrator (self)
   - **Dependencies**: task-004-lol-agentic-observation
   - **Status**: pending
   - **Context Requirements**: Use current orchestrator context

## Agent Selection Rationale
- **simon-says**: Selected for tasks 1-3 because each task begins with "Simon says" and requires command acknowledgment and execution tracking through the event system
- **lol-recorder**: Selected for task 4 because it involves capturing a humorous observation ("lol") about agentic workflows, which fits perfectly with the LOL recorder's purpose of preserving moments of developer humor and insight

## Execution Order
1. Execute first Simon Says command (digital art)
2. Execute second Simon Says command (coding haiku)  
3. Execute third Simon Says command (time travel debugging)
4. Record LOL observation about agentic workflows
5. Complete orchestration workflow

## Context Propagation Strategy
Each agent invocation will include:
- **WORKFLOW_ID**: 12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-987654321mnp (consistent across all tasks)
- **AGENT_ID**: Unique per agent instance (generated at invocation time)
- **PARENT**: orchestrator-1723671008-a2b4c6d8 (this orchestrator instance)
- **TIMESTAMP**: ISO 8601 formatted invocation time

## Expected Outcomes
- Three creative Simon Says commands executed with full event tracking
- One humorous observation about agentic workflows preserved with comprehensive metadata
- Complete event trail showing orchestration flow and agent coordination
- Demonstration of complex multi-agent workflow management
- Preservation of both creative outputs and meta-commentary on the agentic process itself

## Technical Notes
- All agents follow the three-aggregate event system pattern
- Context IDs must be extracted from ===AGENT_CONTEXT=== blocks
- Event emissions track workflow progress and agent interactions
- The LOL observation specifically focuses on the meta-humor of agent coordination
- Each Simon Says command is designed to be creative and varied as requested

## Success Criteria
- All 5 tasks completed successfully
- Event system shows complete workflow traceability
- Simon Says commands demonstrate creativity and variety
- LOL observation captures genuine amusement about agentic workflows
- Orchestration plan saved and accessible for future reference
